	<h3>Roadmap</h3>
	<div class='body-text'>
		<p>
		Packal is not yet fully featured. Developments to come in future versions. These are features that we'd like to implement but haven't so that we could make Packal available. Below is a general roadmap, in no specific order, of tasks to accomplish and feature to implement. This page makes Packal more transparent, but it is also a convenient todo list for the Packal authors.</p>

		<h4>For the Packal Workflow</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><h5>Background updates</h5>
				<p>Update all Workflows with a single Alfred command (without the UI).</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Workflow tracking</h5>
				<p>An option to send information back to the Packal servers about your installed Workflows (anonymously and opt-out) to help collect information about which Workflows you currently have installed and enabled. This will be useful for tracking the popularity of Workflows, both for the authors and to allow us to improve the 'popular' Workflow pages.</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Allow the UI to be opened in a web browser instead of the built-in viewer</h5>
				<p>Delayed for design reasons.</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Better Error Handling</h5>
				<p>Currently, there is minimal error handling within the Workflow. This will be improved to make Packal faster and better.</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Better Alfred Integration</h5>
				<p>We know. Packal is a Workflow and resource for Alfred, but right now it feels like an adjunct application. It can be better integrated into Alfred, and that should happen.</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Implement unit testing</h5>
				<p>Let's write some tests to make sure that Packal functions as well as it can.</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>More configuration options</h5>
				<p>We want Packal to look and work just how you want it to. Let's create these options.</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Better Plist Migration</h5>
				<p>Right now Packal migrates all necessary settings that you've overridden. But, have you changed the icons? Those aren't migrated. There are a few other unnecessary but desirable things that could be migrated.</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Show Changelog</h5>
				<p>Create a way to show a changelog in the updates section</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>A more elegant way to detect Internet connections</h5>
				<p>Currently, the script to detect the Internet connection (to prevent trying to download updates when your computer can't reach the server feels like a bit of a hack. Let's replace it with something better, faster, and more elegant</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Consolidate Packal files</h5>
				<p>There are so many moving parts in Packal, and the logic has been to keep most everything in different scripts. Let's combine in better ways for a more elegantly written application.</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Update scripts for Workflow authors</h5>
				<p>Define routines to update data structures when a workflow is updated.</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>More robust integration with WHW</h5>
				<p>Let's make better help files. Dependent on the release of the next version of WHW.</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Shared asset handling and dependencies</h5>
				<p>Let's allow for Workflows to declare dependencies that can be installed with Packal, allowing for faster updates and an overall smaller footprint for Workflows.</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Replacing the bundled php5.5 webserver with something smaller and faster</h5>
				<p>For size and performance reasons. Also, it isn't necessary with Mavericks because 10.9 has php5.4 built in. This feature is dependent on shared asset handling.</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Faster Github Integration</h5>
				<p>Let's reduce the number of requests to Github to make retrieving package information faster.</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Pushing updates for your published Workflows to the Packal server from Alfred</h5>
				<p>This one is a long way off, but it's a feature that we'd like to implement.</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Tweaking the UI for aesthetics and usability</h5>
				<p>Self-explanatory. Will be an on-going process, never quite done.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>For the Packal Website</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><h5>Create infrastructure for background updates</h5>
				<p>Obviously necessary for the Workflow feature above.</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Create infrastructure for Workflow tracking</h5>
				<p>Necessary for feature outlined above.</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Create an infrastructure for shared asset handling</h5>
				<p>Necessary for feature outlined above.</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Tune server configuration</h5>
				<p>The server can always run faster. I need to optimize the nginx caching, the php configuration files, the Percona configuration files. Perhaps, implement Varnish (I don't know if this is worth doing atop the nginx caching). Employ Redis for faster queries. Better cache control integration with each layer of caching, especially Cloudflare. There are others.</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Create an intelligent way to generate a changelog</h5>
				<p>I never figured out a good way to do this that can integrate well with the appcast. Still thinking on it.</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Website tuning</h5>
				<p>Tune Drupal configurations for speed. Optimize Drupal caching. Speed up views.</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Malicious Workflow reporting</h5>
				<p>Create a good system to allow for feedback for unsecure or potentially damaging Workflows. (We already employ virus scanning).</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Rewrite Workflow objects as stand-alone entities</h5>
				<p>Doing so could increase speed and elegance.</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Improve documentation</h5>
				<p>This is an on-going process. Packal was developed to help people find Workflows because they're currently buried in the forums, and there is a lot of redundancy because it's too much work to comb through the near year-long forum archives to find out if a workflow exists. Also, we'd love for Packal to be a repository of development information to help newer Workflow authors to create better Workflows. Again, there is so much in the forums that is hard to find. This can help. We need this part to be created by the community. Let's do that. We also need a better infrastructure to optimize how the documentation is created and displayed. There is always more to do.</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Create better search utilities</h5>
				<p>It's always good to find better ways to make Workflows easier to find. This might include creating entirely different views, tweaking the UI, or tuning the search engines.</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Tune SEO</h5>
				<p>Let's help people find not only Packal but also individual Workflows through search engines. I mean, people might not know how to find this great resource, right?</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Better Social Media Integration</h5>
				<p>Right now, integration with Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit is primative. Making it more robust can help create a better community by showing more people how great Alfred actually is.</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>A better Workflow author experience</h5>
				<p>Finding and updating your Workflows isn't as good as it could be. Let's make it better by writing a nicer dashboard for Workflow authors. (Partially done, but by no means good enough to be available.</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Highlighting Author Contributions</h5>
				<p>The content of Packal is user contributed. So let's find better ways to give the Workflow authors much deserved credit.</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Better app discovery</h5>
				<p>Workflows integrate with a myriad of OS X apps, and many users have found new applications because of Workflows written for them. Let's make this easier on the Packal site.</p>
			</li>
			<li><h5>Website aesthetics and consistency</h5>
				<p>Packal is lacking some consistency for internal reasons. The theme repository didn't receive much attention in the initial development. Let's make that nicer, and let's make Packal prettier overall.</p>
			</li>
