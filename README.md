Packal Updates
====================

So, like, if you're not me, then this won't work at all because it relies on a local dev install.

Be patient, it will work for everyone in a testing state soon, but the updated server needs to go to __testing__ at the minimum. Right now this branch exists just to save some work outside of my computer, and the code is, like, total crap and doesn't fully work, even in an expected buggy state.
