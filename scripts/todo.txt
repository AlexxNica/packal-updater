For the reporting features...

Get the date by year/week number.
If a file by that name year-week.json does not exist in the usage directory (data/usage), then generate the data and send it to Packal. If there is a response (i.e. it received the data), then write the filename to data/usage/year-week.json so that it doesn't try again.

file directory:

directory: data/usage
