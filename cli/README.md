Packal.phar
===

Packal.phar is a `cli` utility that has most of the same functionality as the Packal workflow does.

The extra files in this folder are either parts of the `.phar` or they are tools to build the `.phar`.

Regardless, the `Packal.phar` cli works as a standalone utility. See `./Packal.phar --usage` for more information.
